# Food-Hygiene-Ratings-Scheme
(The data was scrapped on 9/12/2021)
It is a part of group project. In this project, I was in charge of scrapping, cleaning, processing, and displaying data.

The code in the files shows how the data is scrapped, cleaned, processed, and demonstrated.
At first, the data was scrapped from the website "Food Standards Agency". 
Then, the data was extracted from 376 xml files into a table.
Afterwards, the data was cleaned to match the structure we preferred.
At the end, we applied Shiny dashboard and SQL to display the data.

Take Coventry as an example.
