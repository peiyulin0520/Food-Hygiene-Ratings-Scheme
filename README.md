# Food-Hygiene-Ratings-Scheme
(Data scrapping was performed on 9/12/2021)
It is a part of a group project. I was in charge of scrapping, cleaning, processing, and displaying data in this project.

The code in the files shows how the data is scrapped, cleaned, processed, and demonstrated.
At first, the data was scrapped from the website "Food Standards Agency". 
Then, the data was extracted from 376 XML files into a table.
Afterwards, the data was cleaned to match the structure we preferred.
Ultimately, we applied the Shiny dashboard and SQL to display the data in an easily digestible format.

Take Coventry as an example. 
From the pie chart, we can notice that 63.4% of businesses rated at "5". The second is "Awaiting Inspection" (15.4%), and the third is a score of "4" (11.8%).
From the bar chart, we can observe the business type of each rating score. In this case, the business type "retailers" were rated more at 5 and 4 in Coventry.
For the rating of awaiting inspection, other catering premises accounted for the most significant proportion in Coventry.
On the map, we can observe that many businesses scored at 5 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. But, on the other hand, Fewer businesses in Scotland scored at 5. 
For a score of 0, we can find that it was surrounded by London, Manchester, Birmingham, and Coventry more than other cities.
